Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic approach/ the branch of computer science that deals with the development, design, testing and maintaining of software systems. Software engineers use engineering principles and programming language knowledge to create solutions for end users.
Quality and consistency: software engineering ensures that high-quality software that is created is reliable and meets the expectations and needs of the user.
Efficiency: soft engineering helps in managing resources and time effectively by following processes and structured methodologies.
Most importantly it aims to ensure that the software built should be correct, consistent, and should reduce development costs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Waterfall Model (1970s):
Description: This was one of the first formal methodologies for software development, characterised by a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
The Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s):
Description: Object-oriented programming (OOP) emphasised the use of objects and classes to model real-world entities and interactions.
Agile Methodology (2001):
Description: The Agile Manifesto introduced principles for iterative and incremental development, emphasising flexibility, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Gathering and Analysis:
Explanation: Collecting and analysing the requirements of the software from stakeholders to define what the system should do.
Design:
Explanation: Creating the architecture of the system, including the software and hardware components, to meet the requirements.
Implementation (Coding in action):
Explanation: Writing the actual code based on the design specifications.
Testing:
Explanation: Evaluating the software to identify and fix defects and ensure it meets the requirements. Ensuring that the code for the software actually runs.
Deployment:
Explanation: Releasing the software to users and making it operational.
Maintenance:
Explanation: Ongoing support and updates to fix bugs and accommodate changes.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology:
Characteristics: Sequential, structured phases; fixed scope; heavy documentation.
Pros: Clear milestones and deliverables; well-defined requirements.
Cons: Inflexibility to changes; late testing phase.
Appropriate Scenario: Projects that have well-defined requirements and the low likehood of frequent changes, such as regulatory software.
Agile Methodology:
Characteristics: Iterative, incremental; flexible scope; involves minimal documentation.
Pros: Adaptability to changes; continuous improvement and feedback.
Cons: Less predictability; potential scope creep.
Appropriate Scenario: Projects that have got evolving requirements such as startups developing and creating new products.
The roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Responsibilities: A software developer’s role involves coding, designing, and debugging software: collaboration with different members of the team to ensure that the software meets the correct quality standards and specifications.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
Responsibilities: To test software inorder to identify and resolve possible defects: creating test plans and test cases: ensuring that the software actually meets the quality standards. 
Project Manager:
Responsibilities: As a project manager a software developer serves as a project overseer from beginning until completion: manages timelines, resources, and budgets: coordinates between the development team and stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Explanation: IDEs provide comprehensive tools for coding, debugging, and testing within a single application. Examples include IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code.
Importance: IDEs streamline development by offering features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and integrated debugging.
Version Control Systems (VCS):
Explanation: VCS track changes to code over time and manage multiple versions. Examples include Subversion (SVN) and Git.
Importance: VCS enable collaboration, maintain code history, and manage changes efficiently, reducing the risk of conflicting changes and loss of work.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge: Requirements Changes:
Strategy: Maintaining flexibility and implementing the agile practices to keep up with requirements that keep evolving.
Challenge: Bug Management:
Strategy: Usage of continuous and autmated  integration tools to detect and quickly address bugs.
Challenge: Communication Issues:
Strategy: The use of collaborative tools and fostering clear communication between the stakeholders and team members.
Strategy: Regularly refactor code and prioritise technical debt management to avoid accumulation.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing:
Description: Testing software functions or individual components.
Importance: Ensures that in isolation the different parts of code work correctly.

Integration Testing:
Description: Testing the interaction between integrated systems or components.
Importance: Identifies issues in the interaction between different parts of the software.
System Testing:
Description: Testing the complete and integrated software system.
Importance: Validates the overall performance of the software and the end-to-end functionality.
Acceptance Testing:
Description: Testing the software against user expectations and requirements.
Importance: Ensures that the software is ready for deployment and meets the user's needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to crafting statements or questions to effectively interact with AI models in order to get accurate responses.
Importance:
Enhances Usability: Specific and clear prompts make it easy for users to effectively interact with AI systems and obtain accurate results.
Optimises Performance: Effective prompts reduce the need for extensive adjustments and iterations, improving overall efficiency.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Examples of vague prompts and improvements
Vague prompt:
“Tell me about animals”

Improved prompt:
“Can you provide information on the habitats and diets of African lions?”
The prompt is more efficient because it requires specific subject (African lions) and information (habitats and diets) which will make it easier for the AI prompt to generate detailed, relevant and accurate information.
